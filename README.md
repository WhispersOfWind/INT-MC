INT-MC: Low-Overhead In-Band Network-Wide Telemetry Based on Matrix Completion

In-band Network Telemetry (INT) enhances real-time, highresolution network monitoring capabilities by incorporatingine-grained internal state information into packets. UtilizingINT for network-wide visualization can significantly bolsternetwork management and operation. Although existing stud.ies have made significant contributions, they have not beenable to simultaneously meet the following two objectives: l)Comprehensive visibility of the network's internal state.which refers to obtaining information on all switch ports andthe corresponding link state;2)Low measurement overheadwhich involves reducing measurement bandwidth overheadand minimizing the impact of the measurement process on thenetwork. We designed INT-MC to meet both of these objectives. INT-MMC is an effcient and cost-effective network-widetelemetry solution based on matrix completion. Taking intoaccount the network's spatio-temporal characteristics,INTMC selectively measures certain links. It then employs matrixcompletion algorithms to infer information about unmeasuredlinks, thereby achieving low-overhead network-wide teleme.try. We establish that finding the shortest path to cover theselected links is an NP-hard problem. To circumvent this, wepropose an improved scheme, transforming the path calcula.tion problem into a high-information path selection problem.signifcantly reducing computational cost.
We have implemented an INT-MC prototype within theNSFNet topology, consisting of 14 Tofino switches and 10end-hosts,and conducted extensive experiments and evaluations. The results demonstrate that INT-MC can achievenearly the same accuracy as existing solutions with only 16%of the measurement bandwidth overhead. Even under highfrequency measurements of 20 times per second, the bandwidth overhead of INT-MC is approximately 0.058% of thetotal bandwidth, exerting minimal impact on the network.
